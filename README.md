# General Setup Instructions 

Ensure that you have installed [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) 

### `housing` conda Environment

This project relies on you using the [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file to recreate the `housing` conda environment. To do so, please run the following commands *in your terminal*:
```bash
# create the housing conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
# activate the housing conda environment
conda activate housing
# if needed, make housing available to you as a kernel in jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name housing --display-name "Python 3 (housing)"
```
